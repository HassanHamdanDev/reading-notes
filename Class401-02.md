##  Review, Research, and Discussion


- What’s the difference between PUT and PATCH?

```

The main difference between the PUT and PATCH method is that the PUT method uses the request URI to supply a modified version of the requested resource which replaces the original version of the resource, whereas the PATCH method supplies a set of instructions to modify the resource

PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource.

PATCH is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data.

- Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server

```

Postman 
Stoplight
Mocky.io

```


- Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js

```

>> Popularity:
 By comparing stats,  swagger-ui is more popular then apidocjs.

>> Consistency:
 If we already using swagger for our Dotnetcore service, then implementing swagger tool will consist more from Info and UI prospective.

>> Implementation complexity: 
apidocjs and swagger both required documentation content on implemented method as customize comment data. In addition they allow to write documentation data in separate resource file as .js and .json. If we already have swagger.json created by DotnetCore we can reuse more than 80% specification.

>> Maintenance: 
 For apidocjs will have to modify documentation for each affected method/endpoints if service changed. In swagger we can limit changes. But by implementing apidocjs we can isolate the layer.

>> Other benefits: 
Because swagger use plain .json that could be parsed through programing language, thus we can get advantage of various other 3rd parties in order to create http client and more. 

>> Future:
 Due to popularity of swagger, apidocjs provide information about apidoc-swagger converter so we can switch apidoc to swagger anytime.

- Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?

```

Client error  (4xx)
Server error  (5xx)

```


- Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST


```

The difference is: SOAP is a XML-based message protocol, while REST is an architectural style. SOAP uses WSDL for communication between consumer and provider, whereas REST just uses XML or JSON to send and receive data. SOAP invokes services by calling RPC method, REST just simply calls services via URL path.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms



**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 Web Server | A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.
 Express | Express.js is a modular web framework for Node.js. It is used for easier creation of web applications and services. Express.js simplifies development and makes it easier to write secure, modular and fast applications.
 Routing | Routing defines the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints. Implementation of routing in Node. js: There are two ways to implement routing in node
 WRRC | Web Request Response Cycle.
