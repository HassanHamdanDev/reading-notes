# Debugging


## 

```

If you understand execution contexts (which have two 
stages) and stacks, you are more likely to find the error 
in your code. 
Debugging is the process of finding errors. It involves a 
process of deduction. 
The console helps narrow down the area in which the 
error is located, so you can try to find the exact error. 
JavaScript has 7 different types of errors. Each creates 
its own error object, which can tell you its line number 
and gives a description of the error. 
If you know that you may get an error, you can handle 
it gracefully using the try, catch, finally statements. 
Use them to give your users helpful feedback.

JavaScript can be hard to learn and everyone makes 
mistakes when writing it. This chapter will help you learn 
how to find the errors in your code. It will also teach you how 
to write scripts that deal with potential errors gracefully. 

When you are writing JavaScript, do not expect to write it perfectly the first time. 
Programming is like problem solving: you are given a puzzle and not only do you have to solve 
it, but you also need to create the instructions that allow the computer to solve it. too. 
When writing a long script, nobody gets everything right in their first attempt. The error 
messages that a browser gives look cryptic at first, but they can help you determine what 
went wrong in your JavaScript and how to fix it. In this chapter you will learn about: 

* THE CONSOLE & 
DEV TOOLS 
Tools built into the browser 
that help you hunt for errors. 
* 9 ERROR HANDLING & DEBUGGING 
COMMON 
PROBLEMS 
Common sources of errors, 
and how to solve them. 
* HANDLING 
ERRORS 
How code can deal with 
potential errors gracefully.
