# Context API


## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer()

```

useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks.

```

- Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

```

This is mainly to have an extra option for sharing state and logic between components. Custom hooks are normal JS functions, named with the prefix 'use', that can use hooks inside of it and contain a common stateful logic to be reused in other components.

```

- What do custom hooks usually do?

```

Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated. How does a custom Hook get isolated state? Each call to a Hook gets isolated state.

```

- Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications

- Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work

```

An API fetching hook would take in a url and any info necessary for the request and return the results of the API call. It could use a callback to update the state with the returned results.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 reducer | The useReducer(reducer, initialState) hook accept 2 arguments: the reducer function and the initial state. The hook then returns an array of 2 items: the current state and the dispatch function
