# Mongo and Mongoose

## Reading nosql vs sql

### Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:


**SQL** | **NoSQL**
------------ | -------------
 Relational Databases (RDBMS) | non-relational or distributed database.
 Table based databases | Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
 Predefined schema | Dynamic schema
 Vertically scalable | Horizontally scalable
 Structured query language | Unstructured query language
 | 
 | 


### What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?

```
 complex query intensive environmen

```


### Give a real world example.

```
interfaces

```


### What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

```
hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data

```


### Give a real world example.

```
big data

```


### Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?

```
NoSQL

```


### Which type of database is best for scalability?

```

 SQL

```


## Videos sql vs nosql 


### What does SQL stand for?

```
Structured query language

```


### What is a realational database?

```

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another. ... The columns of the table hold attributes of the data, and each record usually has a value for each attribute, making it easy to establish the relationships among data points.

```


### What type of structure does a relational database work with?

```
Popular examples of standard relational databases include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, MySQL
```


### What is a ‘schema’?

```

We define SQL Schema as a logical collection of database objects. A user owns that owns the schema is known as schema owner. It is a useful mechanism to segregate database objects for different applications, access rights, managing the security administration of databases

```


### What is a NoSQL database?

```

NoSQL, also referred to as “not only SQL”, “non-SQL”, is an approach to database design that enables the storage and querying of data outside the traditional structures found in relational databases

```


### How does it work?

```
Unlike a relational database where data is stored in tables, NoSQL allows for storage, processing and dealing with a wide variety of data models. It offers horizontal scalability based on a schema-less and flexible data model.

```


### What is inside of a Mongo database?

```
Databases, collections, documents are important parts of MongoDB without them you are not able to store data on the MongoDB server. A Database contains a collection, and a collection contains documents and the documents contain data, they are related to each other.

```


### Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.

```
While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

```


### What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?

```
Compatibility issues with SQL instructions. New databases use their own characteristics in the query language and they're not yet 100% compatible with the SQL used in relational databases. Support for work query issues in a NoSQL database is more complicated. Lack of standardizing.
