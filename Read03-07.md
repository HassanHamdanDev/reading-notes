# REST

## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team


```

Like most 25-year-olds, Julia Rozovsky wasn’t sure what she wanted to do with her life. When Rozovsky arrived on campus, she was assigned to a study group carefully engineered by the school to foster tight bonds. Every day, between classes or after dinner, Rozovsky and her four teammates gathered to discuss homework assignments, compare spreadsheets and strategize for exams. ‘‘There are lots of people who say some of their best business-school friends come from their study groups,’’ Rozovsky told me.

Instead, Rozovsky’s study group was a source of stress. When the group met, teammates sometimes jockeyed for the leadership position or criticized one another’s ideas. ‘‘People would try to show authority by speaking louder or talking over each other,’’ Rozovsky told me. So Rozovsky started looking for other groups she could join.

A classmate mentioned that some students were putting together teams for ‘‘case competitions,’’ contests in which participants proposed solutions to real-world business problems that were evaluated by judges, who awarded trophies and cash. When it came time to brainstorm, ‘‘we had lots of crazy ideas,’’ Rozovsky said. One of her favorite competitions asked teams to come up with a new business to replace a student-run snack store on Yale’s campus. Rozovsky proposed a nap room and selling earplugs and eyeshades to make money.

There were ideas about clothing swaps. Most of the proposals were impractical, but ‘‘we all felt like we could say anything to each other,’’ Rozovsky told me.

Rozovsky’s study group dissolved in her second semester . It always struck Rozovsky as odd that her experiences with the two groups were dissimilar. ‘‘I couldn’t figure out why things had turned out so different,’’ Rozovsky told me.

## How I explained REST to my brother

Who is Roy Fielding?

```

He helped write the first web servers, that sent documents across the internet… and then he did a ton of research explaining why the web works the way it does. His name is on the specification for the protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser

```


Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

```

Hmm. Well, it's all pretty amazing really. And the funny thing is that it's all very undervalued. The protocol I mentioned, that he helped write, HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.

Yeah. That first part tells the browser what protocol to use. That stuff you type in there is one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing.

Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

```


What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

```

HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

Web pages usually have images, right? Those are separate resources. The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed. But the important thing here is that very different kinds of nouns can be treated the same. Whether the noun is an image, text, video, an mp3, a slideshow, whatever. I can GET all of those things the same way given a URL.

Exactly. Each of the systems would retrieve information from each other using a simple HTTP GET. If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST. If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT, or, to do a partial update, it'll hopefully use PATCH. The only thing left to figure out is what the data models should look like.

But this is a recent change! Just a few years ago, the large majority of developers were busy writing layers of complex specifications for how to access data in a different way that isn't nearly as useful or eloquent, known as SOAP. Nouns weren't universal and verbs weren't polymorphic. They basically ignored throwing out decades of real field usage and proven technique and kept starting over with something that looks a lot like other systems that have failed in the past. They used HTTP but only because it let them talk to our network and security people less. It was like trading simplicity for flashy tools and wizards.

```


What does a GET do?

```

GET is used to request data from a specified resource.

```


What does a POST do?

```

When power is turned on, POST (Power-On Self-Test) is the diagnostic testing sequence that a computer's basic input/output system (or "starting program") runs to determine if the computer keyboard, random access memory, disk drives, and other hardware are working correctly.

```


What does PUT do?

```

A put option gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell the underlying asset at a specific price through a specific expiration date. A protective put is used to hedge an existing position while a long put is used to speculate on a move lower in prices

```


What does PATCH do?

```

A patch is a set of changes to a computer program or its supporting data designed to update, fix, or improve it. This includes fixing security vulnerabilities and other bugs, with such patches usually being called bugfixes or bug fixes

```
