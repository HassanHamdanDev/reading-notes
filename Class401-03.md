# Express REST API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Name 3 real world use cases where you’d want to change the request with custom middleware

```

Auth middleware
Logging Middleware
Data Access
Robot Middleware

```

- True or false: The route handler is middleware? True 

- In what ways can a middleware function end the process and send data to the browser?

```

They are not middleware functions by definition. If such function is used on routing methods then they are only handler functions. We use such a handler function which is not a middleware when it is the only one callback function


```

- At what point in the request lifecycle can you “inject” middleware?

```
If one of the middleware has instructed the request object to redirect, the view that is ready to execute, will not execute.

For example, if the user is planned on going to the dashboard view, but middleware has told the request to redirect to the login page instead then the dashboard view, and therefore the controller, will not execute at all. It will be skipped over. Masonite checks if the request is redirecting before executing a view.

Also, the request object can be injected into middleware by passing the Request parameter into the constructor 
This will inject the Request class into the constructor when that middleware is executed.

```

- What can cause express to error with “Request headers sent twice, cannot start a second response”

```

The error "Error: Can't set headers after they are sent." means that you're already in the Body or Finished state, but some function tried to set a header or statusCode. When you see this error, try to look for anything that tries to send a header after some of the body has already been written. For example, look for callbacks that are accidentally called twice, or any error that happens after the body is sent.

```


## Document the following Vocabulary Terms
>
>

**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 Middleware | Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object ( req ), the response object ( res ), and the next middleware function in the application's request-response cycle. The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next .
 Request Object | The req object represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, and so on.
 Response Object | The res object represents the HTTP response that an Express app sends when it gets an HTTP request.
 Application Middleware | Application level middleware are bound to an instance of express, using app. use() and app. VERB(). Router level middleware work just like application level middleware except they are bound to an instance of express
 Routing Middleware | the way in which the client requests are handled by the application endpoints. And when you make some routers in separate file, you can use them by using middleware.
 Test Driven Development | an iterate process that begins with writing a test code for an application or function before starting out to write the application. ... The next steps entails writing and refactoring the application until it passes the test code
 Behavioral Testing | Unit testing is a methodology where units of code are tested in isolation from the rest of the application. A unit test might test a particular function, object, class, or module. Unit tests are great to learn whether or not individual parts of an application work. NASA had better know whether or not a heat shield will work before they launch the rocket into space.
