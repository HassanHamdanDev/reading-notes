## Understanding the JavaScript Call Stack


What is a ‘call’?

```
invoke

```


How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?

```

There is no general rule of thumb for recursive or nested functions creating a stack overflow. Instead it is dependent on the memory available on the stack, which may vary depending on underlying hardware and operating system allocations

```


What does LIFO mean?

```
 Last In, First Out data structure.

```


Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.

```

function firstFunction(){
  console.log("Hello from firstFunction");
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
  console.log("The end from secondFunction");
}

secondFunction();


```



What causes a Stack Overflow?

```
A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

```


## JavaScript error messages


What is a ‘refrence error’?

```

This is as simple as when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

This is also a common thing when using const and let, they are hoisted like var and function but there is a time between the hoisting and being declared so when you try to access them a reference error occurs, the fact that this happens to let and const is called Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ).

```


What is a ‘syntax error’?

```
this occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax

```


What is a ‘range error’?

```
Try to manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length and this kind of errors will show up

```


What is a ‘tyep error’?

```
Like the name indicates, this types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

```


What is a breakpoint?

```

When a programmer creates code they can add what is known as a breakpoint. A breakpoint is a point in the program where the code will stop executing. For example, if the programmer amended the logic error in the trace table example they may wish to trigger a break point at line 5 in the algorithm.

```


What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?

```
A debugger is a software tool that can help the software development process by identifying coding errors at various stages of the operating system or application development. Some debuggers will analyze a test run to see what lines of code were not executed.
