# Bearer Authorization

## Review, Research, and Discussion


### Write the following steps in the correct order:0

- Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret
- Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party
- Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint
- Make a request to a third-party API endpoint
- Receive authorization code
- Make a request to the access token endpoint
- Receive access token



- What can you do with an authorization code?

```

The authorization code is a temporary code that the client will exchange for an access token. The code itself is obtained from the authorization server where the user gets a chance to see what information the client is requesting, and approve or deny the request

```


- What can you do with an access token?

```

Access tokens are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user’s data.

```

- What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?

```

It allows you to read data of a user from another application. It supplies the authorization workflow for web, desktop applications, and mobile devices.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 Client ID |  is a unique identifier for a browser–device pair that helps Google Analytics link user actions on a site.
 Client Secret | a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors. 
 Authentication Endpoint |  a security mechanism designed to ensure that only authorized devices can connect to a given network, site or service.
 Access Token Endpoint |  where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. This section describes how to verify token requests and how to return the appropriate response and errors.
 API Endpoint | the URL for a server or a service. These APIs operate through responses and requests — that is you make a request and the API Endpoint makes a response. A simple example of this is this particular Websites and article.
 Authorization Code |  an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.
