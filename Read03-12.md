# CRUD

## Status Codes Based On REST Methods

In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:


```

100’s =  

These are informational status codes; they usually tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client. Like using a different protocol or telling the client that its request will fail before they start sending the body.


200’s =

These are the success codes. They tell the client that its request was accepted. In case of asynchronous processing of a request (202), this doesn’t mean the request was successfully processed only that it met all validation requirements at the time of sending.


300’s =

These are redirection codes. They tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore. This can have multiple reasons, be temporary or permanent, but the client has to issue a request to the new location.


400’s =

These are the client error codes. They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server. There are several causes to this, timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication, etc. A client is sending incorrect input and should confirm the input parameters are correct before retrying the request


500’s =

These are the server error codes. Often they indicate problems with overwhelmed servers or unreachable servers behind proxies, but sometimes they can be directly related to client requests that trigger error exceptions on the server. These errors can be temporary or permanent. Usually it’s best for the client to retry the same request.



```

What is a status code 202?

```

Often used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future. The response body should include an URL to the finished resource with some information about when it will be available, or an URL to some monitoring endpoint that tells the client when the resource is available.

```

What is a status code 308?

```

This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. It’s helpful when we have multiple endpoints for one resource, but don’t want to implement reading from all of them.

```

What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?

```
 use 404 in your case. 204 is a specialized reponse code that you shouldn't often return to a browser in response to a GET

```

What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?

```
the "409 Conflict" is the best existing answer code (as pointed by @Wrikken), maybe including a Location header pointing to the existing resource. IMHO, "307 Temporary Redirect" is the real temporary redirect

```

What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?

```
403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.

```



## Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick - First 20 minutes


Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?

```

env file lets you customize your individual working environment variables. ... env file contains the individual user environment variables that override the variables set in the /etc/environment file. You can customize your environment variables as desired by modifying your . env file.

```


What is middleware?

```
Express middleware are functions that execute during the lifecycle of a request to the Express server. Each middleware has access to the HTTP request and response for each route (or path) it's attached to. ... This “chaining” of middleware allows you to compartmentalize your code and create reusable middleware

```


What does app.use(express.json()) do?

```
express. json() is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object. This method is called as a middleware in your application using the code: app.

```

What does the /:id mean in a route?

```

The Route Order ID is a unique identifier assigned to every order that is protected by Route Package Protection

```

What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?

```
PUT is a method of modifying resource where the client sends data that updates the entire resource . PATCH is a method of modifying resources where the client sends partial data that is to be updated without modifying the entire data.

```

How do you make a defalut value in a schema?

```

You can specify a default value for an item using the default keyword. When a data doesn't have a corresponding value, the value of this keyword will be used instead to do the validation checks. This keyword is not mandatory and the value of this keyword can be anything.

```

What does a 500 error status code mean?

```

Internal Server Error
The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 500 Internal Server Error server error response code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. This error response is a generic "catch-all" response.

```

What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?

```
The 200 status code is by far the most common returned. It means, simply, that the request was received and understood and is being processed. A 201 status code indicates that a request was successful and as a result, a resource has been created (for example a new page).
