# Trees

- **Trees :** *a data structure where a node can have zero or more children. Each node contains a value. Like graphs, the connection between nodes is called edges. A tree is a type of graph, but not all graphs are trees*


## Common Terminology
* Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain it‚Äôs own values, and references to other nodes
* Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
* K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
* Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
* Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
* Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
* Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
* Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf

### Binary Search Tree Representation

* Binary Search tree exhibits a special behavior. A node's left child must have a value less than its parent's value and the node's right child must have a value greater than its parent value.

* BST Basic Operations

*The basic operations that can be performed on a binary search tree data structure, are the following ‚àí*

- Insert ‚àí Inserts an element in a tree/create a tree.

- Search ‚àí Searches an element in a tree.

- Preorder Traversal ‚àí Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.

-Inorder Traversal ‚àí Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.

- Postorder Traversal ‚àí Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.

```
class Node
{
    constructor(data)
    {
        this.data = data;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

// Binary Search tree class
class BinarySearchTree
{
    constructor()
    {
        // root of a binary search tree
        this.root = null;
    }
 
    // function to be implemented
    // insert(data)
    // remove(data)
                 
 
    // Helper function
    // findMinNode()
    // getRootNode()
    // inorder(node)
    // preorder(node)              
    // postorder(node)
    // search(node, data)
}
```

### Insert Operation

- *The very first insertion creates the tree. Afterwards, whenever an element is to be inserted, first locate its proper location. Start searching from the root node, then if the data is less than the key value, search for the empty location in the left subtree and insert the data. Otherwise, search for the empty location in the right subtree and insert the data.*

### Search Operation

- *Whenever an element is to be searched, start searching from the root node, then if the data is less than the key value, search for the element in the left subtree. Otherwise, search for the element in the right subtree. Follow the same algorithm for each node.*


## Summary


- The tree is a data structure where a node has 0 or more descendants/children.
- Tree nodes don‚Äôt have cycles (acyclic). If it has cycles, it is a Graph data structure instead.
- Trees with two children or less are called: Binary Tree
- When a Binary Tree is sorted so that the left value is less than the parent and the right children is higher, then and only then we have a Binary Search Tree.
- You can visit a tree in a pre/post/in-order fashion.
- An unbalanced has a time complexity of O(n). ü§¶üèª‚Äç
- A balanced has a time complexity of O(log n). üéâ
