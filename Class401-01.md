## what Array.map() does

```

The Array. map() method allows you to iterate over an array and modify its elements using a callback function. The callback function will then be executed on each of the array's elements

```


## what Array.reduce() does

```
reduce() method in JavaScript is used to reduce the array to a single value and executes a provided function for each value of the array (from left-to-right) and the return value of the function is stored in an accumulator.

## code snippets showing how to use superagent() to fetch data from a URL and log the result

- With normal Promise .then() syntax

```
'use strict';

const superagent = require('superagent');

let name = 'Luke Skywalker';

let promiseStarWars = superagent('GET', 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/1')
  .then((response) => {
    if (name === response.body.name){
      console.log('Luke Skywalker', response.body);
  }else{
    console.log('not luke', response.body);
  }
  });

```
- with async / await syntax

```
'use strict';

const superagent = require('superagent');

let name = 'Luke Skywalker'

async function promiseStarWars(name) {
  let respnse = await superagent('GET', 'https://swapi.dev/api/people/1');
  if (name === response.body.name){
      console.log('Luke Skywalker', response.body);
  }else{
    console.log('not luke', response.body);
  }
};

promiseStarWars(name);

## Explain promises as though you were mentoring a Code 301 level student

```

Code that may take some unknown amount of time to get information and needs that information to continue

## Are all callback functions considered to be Asynchronous? Why or Why Not?

```

Simply taking a callback doesn't make a function asynchronous. There are many examples of functions that take a function argument but are not asynchronous. ... It iterates over each item and calls the function once per item. This can be used among other things to calculate total value from a property of each item.
