# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- What are serverless functions?

```

programmatic function written by a software developer for a single purpose. It's then hosted and maintained on infrastructure by cloud computing companies. These companies take care of code maintenance and execution so that developers can deploy new code faster and easier

```

- If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?

```

I would like to create some kind of system based on event listeners. These event listeners will listen for the trigger events, and fire the functions as soon as those events are executed.

```


- Describe how a CDN works

```

 content delivery network (CDN) refers to a geographically distributed group of servers which work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos
