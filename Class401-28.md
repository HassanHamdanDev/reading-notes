# Component Lifecycle / useEffect() Hook

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Why do we not need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?

```

Using the react-router-dom package, we can implement multiple routes in a React application. A user browsing this app feels each route is on each page. So in React, multiple routes are considered as multiple pages

```


- If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where would we put it and why?

  * Inside the `<BrowserRouter />`, outside a `<Route />`

  *  the way they store the URL and communicate with your web server. A `<BrowserRouter> `uses regular URL paths.Specifically, your web server needs to serve the same page at all URLs that are managed client-side by React Router.



- What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested


```
the mechanism by which requests (as specified by a URL and HTTP method) are routed to the code that handles them. As we've already noted, routing used to be file based and very simple: if you put the file foo/about. html on your website, you would access it from the browser with the path /foo/about. html.

```


- What does props.children contain?


```
props. children does is that it is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component. This component contains an <img> that is receiving some props and then it is displaying {props. children} 


```


- How do useState() and this.setState() differ?


```

Unlike the setState method found in class components, useState does not automatically merge update objects. You can replicate this behavior by combining the function updater form with object spread syntax: setState(prevState => { // Object.

```





## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 State Hook | a Hook (function) that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.
 Mounting and Un-Mounting | The main job of React is to figure out how to modify the DOM to match what the components want to be rendered on the screen. React does so by "mounting" (adding nodes to the DOM), "unmounting" (removing them from the DOM), and "updating" (making changes to nodes already in the DOM).
