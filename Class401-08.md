# Access Control (ACL)


## Review, Research, and Discussion


- When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?

```

basic is string-based while the bearer is token-based, the bearer is more secure than basic since the tokens are encrypted



```

- What does the JSON Web Token package do?

```

JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.


```

- What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?

```

Secrets management refers to the tools and methods for managing digital authentication credentials (secrets), including passwords, keys, APIs, and tokens for use in applications, services, privileged accounts and other sensitive parts of the IT ecosystem.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 encryption | a means of securing digital data using one or more mathematical techniques, along with a password or "key" used to decrypt the information
 token | used in bearer authentication, a token is a cryptic string that is generated by the server in response to a login request
 bearer |  (We can get it by requesting to certain endpoint)Most known jwt(json web token)
 secret | this is what is paired with a token, a secret string stored on the server used to sign and encode the token
 JSON Web Token | (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.
