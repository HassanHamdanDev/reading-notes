# AWS: S3 and Lambda


## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Describe “The Cloud”

```


refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

```
- What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?

```


a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. Inside a container are all the necessary executables, binary code, libraries, and configuration files.

```


- What is auto-scaling?

```

 a method used in cloud computing that dynamically adjusts the amount of computational resources in a server farm - typically measured by the number of active servers - automatically based on the load on the farm.

```


- What is bandwidth?

```


The maximum amount of data transmitted over an internet connection in a given amount of time. Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).


```


- How do cloud providers compute service costs?

```


The key cost factors which decide cloud hosting prices are storage, networking and computing. ... So, the vendor will consider the total virtual memory or RAM used in public clouds and divides this into costs for every rack unit of the hardware. Costs will include licensing fees depending on the OS you use

```



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 Server Instances | In very simple words, the server running our app is called an instance. Think of one server as one example. An example is a virtual machine running our workloads in the cloud. One instance can host our workload or it can be hosted by a large number of them all.
 Containers | a form of operating system virtualization. A single container might be used to run anything from a small microservice or software process to a larger application. ... Compared to server or machine virtualization approaches, however, containers do not contain operating system images
 Cloud Services | infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. ... Users can access cloud services with nothing more than a computer, operating system, and internet connectivity or virtual private network (VPN)
 Cloud Architecture | refers to the various components in terms of databases, software capabilities, applications, etc. engineered to leverage the power of cloud resources to solve business problems. Cloud architecture defines the components as well as the relationships between them.
 AWS | cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the primary profit driver for Amazon. AWS provides servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development, and security.
 EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku | The 30-thousand-foot comparison of these, Heroku and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, solutions (production configurations) is that they have comparable features and pricing. On the other hand, Heroku is generally simpler to get up and running as AWS has a fairly steep initial learning curve
