  # Passing Functions as Props

##  React Docs - lists and keys


1. What does .map() return?


```
the new array 

```


2. If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?


```
You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.


```


3. Each list item needs a unique __A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. __.


4. What is the purpose of a key?


```
Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity

```




##  The Spread Operator


1. What is the spread operator?


```
The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments.

```


2. List 4 things that the spread operator can do.


```
- Copying an array
- Concatenating or combining arrays
- Using Math functions
- Using an array as arguments
- Adding an item to a list
- Adding to state in React
- Combining objects
- Converting NodeList to an array

```


3. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.


using the … spread operator is a convenient way to copy an array or combine arrays, and it can even add new items:


```
const fruits = ['🍏','🍊','🍌','🍉','🍍']
const moreFruits = [...fruits];
console.log(moreFruits) // Array(5) [ "🍏", "🍊", "🍌", "🍉", "🍍" ]
fruits[0] = '🍑'
console.log(...[...fruits,'...',...moreFruits]) //  🍑 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍 ... 🍏 🍊 🍌 🍉 🍍

```


4. Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.

As noted in the last example, the spread operator can add an item to an another array with a natural, easy-to-understand syntax:

```
const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]

```



5. Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.


The spread syntax is useful for combining the properties and methods on objects into a new object

```

const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂

```




## How to Pass Functions Between Components

1. In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?


```
You can pass state values to a child component as a prop, but you can also pass functions directly to the child component 

```


2. In your own words, what does the increment function do?


```
The Increment( ) function determines the next node at the same level. You can also increase the level of a node by one at a specified level

```


3. How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?


```
Create a callback function in the parent component. This callback function will get the data from the child component.
Pass the callback function in the parent as a prop to the child component.
The child component calls the parent callback function using props.

```


4. How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?


```


Create a boolean variable in the state in the parent class. Update this when you want to call a function. Create a prop variable and assign the boolean variable. From the child component access that variable using props and execute the method you want by having an if condition.

```
