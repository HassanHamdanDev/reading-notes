# Readings: AWS: Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle

```

All backend technologies and web APIs are based on one system that is The Request-Response Cycle. The system is responsible for data interchange between client and servers. ... Request/Response objects are transmitted over the web. Content like images, HTML, CSS, JavaScript is all Response Objects.


```
- Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC

```

The client (usually a browser) opens a connection to the server and sends a request. The server processes the request, generates a response, and closes the connection if it finds a Connection: Close header. ... Headers may provide various information about the request or the client body data.


```

- What does it mean to “deploy” an application?

```

Application Deployment (also referred to as Software Deployment) is the process of installing, configuring, and enabling a specific application or set of applications, usually through an application manager (app manager) or software management system, to a specific URL on a server.

 Pub/Sub | It is stands for Publisher/Subscriber. It allows services to communicate asynchronously, with latencies on the order of 100 milliseconds. It enables you to create systems of event producers and consumers, called publishers and subscribers

## Amazon EC2

```
Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

Amazon EC2 offers the broadest and deepest compute platform with choice of processor, storage, networking, operating system, and purchase model. We offer the fastest processors in the cloud and we are the only cloud with 400 Gbps ethernet networking. We have the most powerful GPU instances for machine learning training and graphics workloads, as well as the lowest cost-per-inference instances in the cloud. More SAP, HPC, Machine Learning, and Windows workloads run on AWS than any other cloud.
