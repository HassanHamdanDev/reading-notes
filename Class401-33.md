# <Login /> and <Auth />

## Review, Research, and Discussion

* Why is the Context API useful?

```

The Context API is a React structure that enables you to exchange unique details and assists in solving prop-drilling from all levels of your application.

```

* Can a component outside of a provider get its context?

```

To access a React context outside of the render function, we can use the useContext hook. We create the UserContext by calling the React. createContext method with a default context value. Then in the Users component, we call the useContext hook with UserContext to accxess the current value of UserContext .

```


* What are some common use cases for using the Context API?

```

Some sample use cases where the Context API proves helpful are: Theming — Pass down app theme. i18n — Pass down translation messages. Authentication 

```

* Describe “Context Hell”

```

Like the callback hell, usual when jQuery was used for everything, the React Context hell is the nasty code you get taking advantage of the React Context API.

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 global state | To put it simply, global state is the data that is shared between all the components within a React application. When the state is changed, or let's say a filter is added, the components re-render accordingly
 global context | Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. For example, in the code below we manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component: class App extends React.
 provider | The <Provider> component makes the Redux store available to any nested components that need to access the Redux store. Since any React component in a React Redux app can be connected to the store, most applications will render a <Provider> at the top level, with the entire app's component tree inside of it.
 consumer | MyContext.Consumer> {value => /* render something based on the context value */} </MyContext.Consumer> A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component. Requires a function as a child.
