## Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

- ### JavaScript

*JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative styles. This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments.*

*The JavaScript documentation throughout MDN is based on the latest draft versions of ECMA-262 and ECMA-402. Do not confuse JavaScript with the Java programming language. Both «Java» and «JavaScript» are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U. .*

* Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks

This module gives you some fundamental background knowledge about how client-side frameworks work and how they fit into your toolset, before moving on to tutorial series covering some of today's most popular ones.

- ### JavaScript Variable


**JavaScript allows you to work with three primitive data types −**

* Numbers : 123, 120.50 

* Strings of text : "This text string" 

* Boolean : true or false.


Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.
```
<script type = "text/javascript">
   <!--
      var money;
      var name;
   //-->
</script>
```
You can also declare multiple variables with the same var keyword as follows −
```
><script type = "text/javascript">
>   <!--
>      var money, name;
>   //-->
></script>
```
Storing a value in a variable is called variable initialization. You can do variable initialization at the time of variable creation or at a later point in time when you need that variable.

For instance, you might create a variable named money and assign the value 2000.50 to it later. For another variable, you can assign a value at the time of initialization as follows.
```
<script type = "text/javascript">
   <!--
      var name = "Ali";
      var money;
      money = 2000.50;
   //-->
 </script>
```

- ## How Computers Work

* Input
* Storage
* Processing
* Output

 "Computers are great because when you're working with them you get immediate results that let you know if your program works. It's feedback you don't get from many other things." "I've never done anything solo, except take tests."
