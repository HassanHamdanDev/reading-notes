# Open-Source Software Contribution



## Open-Source Software

```
Open-source software is a rapidly growing industry that provides many benefits to the individuals and businesses who use it, as well as to its programmers. For many outside of the IT world, the concept of contributing to open-source software seems like a remarkable psychological phenomenon, as many of the contributors do it by their own free will and are quite often unpaid for it.

## What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?

- Improve Coding Skills
```
This jumping-in-the-deep-end style of learning provides aspiring programmers with real-life, first-hand experience and greatly accelerates their learning curve. In order to help young programmers improve their skills, a number of OSS projects now include tickets designed for aspiring programmers to gain genuine programming experience, such as Symfony’s selection of easy picks. Apart from providing novice programmers with experience, they also free up the core developers’ schedule so they can spend that time tackling more difficult issues or improving the software in other ways.
```
- Increase Community and Peer Recognition
```
Most people who are passionate about something strive to be recognized for the quality work they produce, and for some, developing software is a huge passion. Many developers are extremely determined to become the best developer they can be to meet certain personal goals, and having your code accepted by a big OSS project is a considered a massive achievement.
```
- Greater Job Prospects
```
In contrast, commercial software doesn’t provide you with the same proof of your abilities, and overall it is much harder to gain experience in this realm. Improve Software on a User and Business Level. A lot of the time, developers first come across OSS as users. The beauty of OSS compared to proprietary software is that this is all possible.
```
```
Even if a user isn’t a programmer, he or she can still suggest new features and functionalities to the software’s owner or core team. If a business owner or company is using a piece of open-source software and would like to make some changes or add new features to meet a certain business need, then this is also a real possibility. The result is a win-win situation, as the business gets a new feature and the software also receives a new feature that can often be utilized by other users. Here at Clearcode, our development teams regular utilize open-source software in their projects due to the many benefits it offers.
