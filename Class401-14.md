# Event Driven Architecture

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
```
FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.
```
-- How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
```
by reseving a responce from client side 
```
- What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
```
It is the Observer pattern
The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods
```
- How do you test an event driven system?
```
There are multiple levels of tests you will typically write for your system. In the most canonical case, you will write unit tests, service tests, and end-to-end tests. In each of these cases
```

## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


- **FIFO Queue** : FIFO is an abbreviation for first in, first out. It is a method for handling data structures where the first element is processed first and the newest element is processed last
- **Pub/Sub** : Publish/subscribe messaging, or pub/sub messaging, is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures. In a pub/sub model, any message published to a topic is immediately received by all of the subscribers to the topic
