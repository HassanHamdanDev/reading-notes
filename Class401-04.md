# Data Modeling


## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development

```

The software design becomes modular

When using the TDD approach, developers narrow their focus to a single feature at a time, not moving to the next one until the associated unit test is passed.

The code is easier to maintain

Arranged code is much easier to deal with when it comes to modifications.

Code refactoring goes more smoothly

One of the greatest advantages of test-driven development is making the code much more manageable. Furthermore, TDD helps to significantly cut the total hours spent on testing and maintenance activities.

Project costs descrease; ROI goes up

With the implementation of the TDD approach, the general cost of product development typically decreases, as maintenance and bug fixes take less time and effort.


```


- In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?

```
beforeEach()/afterEach() automatically run before and after each tests, which 
1. removes the explicit calls from the tests themselves, and 
2. Tests should be explicit, and tests should never share state.

```



- What is one downside of Test Driven Development

```

The development of the code is slow. The rapid development of code is not possible because we have to write the test cases first, But it long term the development is very fast. The code of TDD is hard to understand as we know writing a code and writing a code well is different

```


- Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?

```
The most important difference between class- and prototype-based inheritance is that a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance. ... A class constructor creates an instance of the class.

```

- Why REST?

```
they provide a great deal of flexibility. Data is not tied to resources or methods, so REST can handle multiple types of calls, return different data formats and even change structurally with the correct implementation of hypermedia

```



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 functional programming | a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions.When a pure function is called with some given arguments, it will always return the same result, and cannot be affected by any mutable state or other side effects
 object-oriented programming (OOP) | the term used to describe a programming approach based on objects and classes. The object-oriented paradigm allows us to organise software as a collection of objects that consist of both data and behaviour. This is in contrast to conventional functional programming practice that only loosely connects data and behaviour
 class | a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.
 super | The super keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent.
 this | determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called
 Test Driven Development (TDD) |  software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is fully developed, and tracking all software development by repeatedly testing the software against all test cases.
 Jest | Jest is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. with afocus on simplicity.It works with projects using: Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular and Vue.js.It aims to work out of the box and config free.
 Continuous Integration (CI) | the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It's a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run.
 REST | Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that specifies constraints, such as the uniform interface, that if applied to a web service induce desirable properties, such as performance, scalability, and modifiability, that enable services to work best on the Web.
 Data Model | an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities. ... The term data model can refer to two distinct but closely related concepts
