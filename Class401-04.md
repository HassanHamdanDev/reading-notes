## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 functional programming | A web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to display website content through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.
