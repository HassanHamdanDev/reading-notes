#  Redux - Combined Reducers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

- Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?

```

 Redux works around the idea of having a central state called a store. To change the state, a component has to dispatch an action. The action is then passed on to the reducer, which changes the state of our application

```

- What is the purpose of a reducer?

```

a reducer is a pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state. The action describes what happened and it is the reducer's job to return the new state based on that action.

```

- What does an action contain?

```

Actions are the only source of information for the store as per Redux official documentation. It carries a payload of information from your application to store. It is recommended to keep your action object as light as possible and pass only the necessary information

```

- Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?

```

In the documentation of reducers(read it again for details!), redux only requires our reducers to stay pure. If the new state is different, the reducer must create new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged par

```



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms

**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 immutable state | If an object is immutable, any changes that need to be made to it within a function must be made to a copy of the object.
 time travel in redux | the process of logging actions and state during an app's execution. Since it represents the entire state of an application at a given moment, it is often used in web development for time-travel debugging and to view Redux actions
 action creator | is a function that literally creates an action object. In Redux, action creators simply return an action object and pass the argument value if necessary.
 reducer |  s a pure function that takes an action and the previous state of the application and returns the new state. The action describes what happened and it is the reducer's job to return the new state based on that action.
 dispatch |  is a function of the Redux store. You call store. dispatch to dispatch an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change. With React Redux, your components never access the store directly - connect does it for you.
