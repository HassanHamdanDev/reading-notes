# Application State with Redux


## Review, Research, and Discussion


- What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”

```

Local storage is vulnerable because it's easily accessible using JavaScript and an attacker can retrieve your access token and use it later. However, while httpOnly cookies are not accessible using JavaScript, this doesn't mean that by using cookies you are safe from XSS attacks involving your access token.

```

- Explain 3rd party cookies.

```

Third-party cookies are created by domains that are not the website (or domain) that you are visiting. These are usually used for online-advertising purposes and placed on a website through adding scripts or tags. A third-party cookie is accessible on any website that loads the third-party server's code.

```

- How do pixel tags work?


```

 attach to a browser and collect information about an anonymous user's movements on the Internet. These little beacons allow sites to provide users with ads for services and products that are relevant to them

 ```



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 cookies | HTTP cookies, or internet cookies, are built specifically for Internet web browsers to track, personalize, and save information about each user's session. A “session” just refers to the time you spend on a site. Cookies are created to identify you when you visit a new website.
 authorization | the process of verifying what specific applications, files, and data a user has access to. The situation is like that of an airline that needs to determine which people can come on board
 access control | a fundamental component of data security that dictates who's allowed to access and use company information and resources. Through authentication and authorization, access control policies make sure users are who they say they are and that they have appropriate access to company data
 conditional rendering |  you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application. Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript.
