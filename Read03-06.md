# NODE.JS 


## An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com


1. What is node.js?

```

There are plenty of definitions to be found online. Let’s take a look at a couple of the more popular ones. This is what the project’s home page has to say:

Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

And this is what Stack Overflow has to offer:

Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

Hmmm, “event-based”, “non-blocking”, “asynchronous I/O” — that’s quite a lot to digest in one go. So let’s approach this from a different angle and begin by focusing on the other detail that both descriptions mention — the V8 JavaScript engine.

```


2. In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?


```

V8 is Google's open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others.

```


3. What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?


```

This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime.

```


4. What is npm?


```

 write a couple of simple programs. We’ll also look at npm, a package manager that comes bundled with Node.


NPM is a node package manager. It is basically used for managing dependencies of various server side dependencies. We can manages our server side dependencies manually as well but once our project's dependencies grow it becomes difficult to install and manage

```


5. What version of node are you running on your machine?


```

v14.17.3

```


6. What version of npm are you running on your machine?


```

6.14.13

```


7. What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?


```

npm install -g jshint

```


8. What is node used for?


```
Now that we know what Node and npm are and how to install them, we can turn our attention to the first of their common uses: installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

These build tools come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

3. How does pair programming work?


```

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
