# Advanced State with Reducers


## Review, Research, and Discussion

- How can we ensure that an effect hook runs only once?

```

If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ( [] ) as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn't depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run.

```

- Can useState() update more than one state variable at the same time?

```
To update the component's state invoke the updater function setState(newState) with the new state. The component re-renders and state receives the new value newState.,Invoking the state updater function setState(newState) with the new value updates the state.

```

- Is useState() synchronous?

```
useState and setState both are asynchronous. They do not update the state immediately but have queues that are used to update the state object. This is done to improve the performance of the rendering of React components. Even though they are asynchronous, the useState and setState functions do not return promises.

```



## Document the following Vocabulary Terms


**Term** | **Def**
------------ | -------------
 State Hook | a Hook (function) that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another function to update this value.
 Component Lifecycle | Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases. The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.
