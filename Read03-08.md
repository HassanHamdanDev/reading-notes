# APIs

## API Design Best Practices

What does REST stand for?


```
Representational State Transfer

```


REST APIs are designed around a __resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.__.


What is an identifer of a resource? Give an example.

```
A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:

HTTP

https://adventure-works.com/orders/1

```

What are the most common HTTP verbs?

```
 The most common operations are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE

```

What should the URIs be based on?

```
URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

```

Give an example of a good URI.

```

https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

https://adventure-works.com/create-order // Avoid

```

What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?

```

Reason why chatty APIs are considered poor quality is because requiring multiple network calls will slow down an application. This is because each call contains data overhead (i.e. sender information, headers, authentication) which will slow down an application as well as network latency per each request.

```

What status code does a successful GET request return?

```
2xx 

```

What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?

```
 400 Bad Request

```

What status code does a successful POST request return?

```
The 2xx (Successful)
202/Accepted

```

What status code does a successful DELETE request return?

```
HTTP 200 or HTTP 204

```
