How to Solve Programming Problems

This time I am going to try and give you some good tools to enable you to get good at solving programming problems.

- Common mistakes lolcatthink

When most programmers are given a programming problem in an interview, they make several key mistakes. The most common mistake I see when conducting interviews or watching someone try to solve a programming problem is they try to start writing code as soon as possible. You really want to make sure you take enough time to understand the problem completely before attempting to solve it. Keep it simple, don’t try to get fancy.

- A simple set of steps

I am going to give you a simple set of steps to follow which you can use for any algorithm type programming problem. Read the problem completely twice. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.

I cannot over-emphasize how important this step is!

If you are given any examples along with the problem, make sure you have worked through the examples and understand why the answers are correct for each one.

«Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually!»

- Optimize the manual solution

What you want to do here is figure out if there is another way you can solve the problem easier, or if there are some steps you can cut our or simplify. We should be able to immediately recognize that we can use a loop here to reduce the manual steps. Start at the last letter in the word and create a new empty word.

- Append the current letter to the new word

If there is a previous letter, make the previous letter the current letter and start back at 3. Writing code should now become very easy.

- Write pseudo-code or comments

Many times you can skip this step if you have a really good handle on the problem or your previous steps already created a detailed enough description of the solution that coding it is already a 1 to 1 translation. What we want to do here is capture all the steps we created and now either put them into our editor as comments or write them as psuedo-code that we can translate to real code.

- Replace comments with real code

If you have done all the other steps, this step involves no problem solving at all. All we do here is take each comment and convert it into a real line of code.

## How to think like a programmer

```


We all have problems. Big and small. How we deal with them is sometimes, well…pretty random.
Unless you have a system, this is probably how you "solve" problems practicing it.
"Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.


Have a framework

To find the right framework, I followed the advice in Tim Ferriss’ book on learning, "The 4-Hour Chef".


Soon, you too will know them.
Sidenote: this doesn’t mean they did everything the same way. Everyone is different. You’ll be different.

Understand

Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them .


Most programmers know this feeling.
This is why you should write down your problem, doodle a diagram, or tell someone else about it .


Plan

Nothing can help you if you can’t write down the exact steps.


Pay attention. This is the most important step of all.
Do not try to solve one big problem. You will cry.
Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.
Then, solve each sub-problem one by one. Begin with the simplest. Simplest means you know the answer .
After that, simplest means this sub-problem being solved doesn’t depend on others being solved.
Once you solved every sub-problem, connect the dots.
Connecting all your "sub-solutions" will give you the solution to the original problem.


Stuck?

By now, you’re probably sitting there thinking "Hey Richard... That’s cool and all, but what if I’m stuck and can’t even solve a sub-problem??"


Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging .
"The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.
Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
"Sometimes we get so lost in the details of a problem that we overlook general principles that would solve the problem at a more general level.


Practice

Practice. Practice. Practice.

Chess puzzles, math problems, Sudoku, Go, Monopoly, video-games, cryptokitties, bla… bla… bla….
In fact, a common pattern amongst successful people is their habit of practicing "micro problem-solving." For example, Peter Thiel plays chess, and Elon Musk plays video-games.


So, what you should do is find an outlet to practice.

## The 5 Whys

```


Origins of the 5 Whys Technique

Sakichi Toyoda, the Japanese industrialist, inventor, and founder of Toyota Industries, developed the 5 Whys technique in the 1930s. It became popular in the 1970s, and Toyota still uses it to solve problems today. Toyota has a «go and see» philosophy. The 5 Whys technique is true to this tradition, and it is most effective when the answers come from people who have hands-on experience of the process or problem in question.

When to Use a 5 Whys Analysis

You can use 5 Whys for troubleshooting, quality improvement, and problem solving, but it is most effective when used to resolve simple or moderately difficult problems. It may not be suitable if you need to tackle a complex or critical problem. This is because 5 Whys can lead you to pursue a single track, or a limited number of tracks, of inquiry when, in fact, there could be multiple causes. The tool's simplicity gives it great flexibility, too, and 5 Whys combines well with other methods and techniques, such as Root Cause Analysis .

Assemble a Team

Gather together people who are familiar with the specifics of the problem, and with the process that you're trying to fix.

Define the Problem

If you can, observe the problem in action. Discuss it with your team and write a brief, clear problem statement that you all agree on.

Ask the First «Why?»

Ask your team why the problem is occurring. This prevents 5 Whys from becoming just a process of deductive reasoning, which can generate a large number of possible causes and, sometimes, create more confusion as you chase down hypothetical problems.

Tip

The diagram, below, shows an example of 5 Whys in action, following a single lane of inquiry. The 5 Whys method also allows you to follow multiple lanes of inquiry. You'll know that you've revealed the root cause of the problem when asking «why» produces no more useful responses, and you can go no further. The «5» in 5 Whys is really just a «rule of thumb .» In some cases, you may need to ask «Why?» a few more times before you get to the root of the problem.

In other cases, you may reach this point before you ask your fifth «Why?» If you do, make sure that you haven't stopped too soon, and that you're not simply accepting «knee-jerk» responses. The important point is to stop asking «Why?» when you stop producing useful responses. As you work through your chain of questions, you may find that someone has failed to take a necessary action. The great thing about 5 Whys is that it prompts you to go further than just assigning blame, and to ask why that happened.

Monitor Your Measures

Keep a close watch on how effectively your counter-measures eliminate or minimize the initial problem.

## what the heck is the event loop anyway

```

As in the event loop inside JavaScript. I'd heard V8 as a term, chrome's Runtime didn't really know what that meant, what that did. I'd heard things like single threaded, you know obviously I'm using callbacks. I started a journey of like reading and research and experimenting in the browser which basically started like this.


So if we look at the JavaScript Runtime itself like V8 which is the Runtime inside Chrome. This is a simplified view of what JavaScript Runtime is. The heap, where memory allocation happens, and then there's the call stack, which is where your stack frames are and all that kind of stuff, but, if you, like, clone the V8 code base and grep for things like setTimeout or DOM or HTTP request, they're not in there, they don't exist in V8, which was a surprise to me. So, over this 18 months of discovery I come to realize this is really, this is really the bigger picture, this is what I'm hoping to get you on board with today and understand what these pieces are, we have the V8 Runtime but then we have these things called web APIs which are extra things that the browser provides.

DOM, AJAX, time out, things like that, we have this mythical event loop and the callback queue. So, JavaScript is a single threaded programming language, single threaded Runtime, it has a single call stack. We have a function main which calls foo which calls foo, which calls foo, which calls foo, and ultimately chrome says, you probably didn't mean to call foo 16,000 times recursively, I'll just kill things for you and you can figure out where your bug lies, right.

## The Super Mario Effect


```


“The trick to learning more and having more success is finding the right way to frame the learning process.”

“What if you just framed the learning process in such a way that you didn’t concern yourself with failure? How much more successful could you be? How much more could you learn?”

“The focus and obsession is about beating the game, not about how dumb you might look. And as a direct result of that attitude—of learning from but not being focused on the failures—we got really good and we learned a ton in a really short amount of time.”

“This is what I call The Super Mario Effect: Focusing on the princess and not the pits, to stick with a task and learn more.”

“When you frame a challenge or a learning process in the way I’m describing, you actually want to do it. It feels natural to ignore the failures and try again in the same way a toddler will want to get up and try to walk again or in the same way you want to keep playing Super Mario Brothers.”

“I really believe if you reframe the challenges it will make all the difference. My approach is to sort of trick you into learning something through something cool.”

“By reframing the learning process, the fear of failure is often taken off the table and learning comes more naturally.”

“By shifting your focus to the princess and treating your life’s challenges like video games, you can trick your brain and actually learn more and see more success.”

“Failing and failing and failing and eventually succeeding."
