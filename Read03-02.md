# State and Props

## React lifecycle

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

```
 the ‘render’

```


2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

```
static getDerivedStateFromProps()

```


3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

```
constructor
render
componentDidMount
React Updates
componentWillUnmount

```


4. What does componentDidMount do?

```
This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().

```



## React State Vs Props


1. What types of things can you pass in the props?


```
React allows us to pass values from a parent component down to a child component. The values can be any data type

```

2. What is the big difference between props and state?


```
The key difference between props and state is that state is internal and controlled by the component itself while props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component

```

3. When do we re-render our application?


```
A re-render can only be triggered if a component's state has changed. The state can change from a props change, or from a direct setState change. The component gets the updated state and React decides if it should re-render the component.

```

4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?


```
Local state

When React was first introduced, we were presented with local state. The important thing to know about local state is that when a state value changes, it triggers a re-render.

Redux store

With Redux, we get a global store. This store lives at the highest level of your app and passes data down to all children.

```
