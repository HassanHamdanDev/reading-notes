# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model

## Lists

```
- There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, 
- unordered, and definition. 
- Ordered lists use numbers.
- Unordered lists use bullets.
- Definition lists are used to define terminology.
- Lists can be nested inside one another
```
## Boxes

```
- CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box. 
- You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
- You can also control the borders, margin and padding 
for each box with CSS.
- It is possible to hide elements using the display and 
visibility properties.
- Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and 
inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
- Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of 
boxes containing text and the leading.
- CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image 
borders and rounded borders

## Basic JavaScript Instructions

```
You should consider using an 
array whenever you are working 
with a list or a set of values that 
are related to each other. 
Arrays are especially helpful 
when you do not know how 
many items a list will contain 
because, when you create the 
array, you do not need to specify 
how many values it will hold. 
If you don't know how many 
items a list will contain, rather 
than creating enough variables 
for a long list (when you might 
only use a small percentage 
of them), using an array is 
considered a better solution. 
For example, an array can be 
suited to storing the individual 
items on a shopping list because 
it is a list of related items. 
Additionally, each time you write 
a new shopping list, the number 
of items on it may differ. 
As you will see on the next page, 
values in an array are separated 
by commas. 
In Chapter 12, you will see that 
arrays can be very helpful when 
representing complex data.

## Decisions and Loops

```
Conditional statements allow your code to make 
decisions about what to do next. 
Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) 
are used to compare two operands. 
Logical operators allow you to combine more than one 
set of comparison operators. 
if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code 
if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
switch statements allow you to compare a value 
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default 
option if none match). 
Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy. 
There are three types of loop: for, while, and 
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
