# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Links

```

 Links are created using the <a> element.
 The <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate 
the page you are linking to.
 If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is 
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
 You can create links to open email programs with an 
email address in the "to" field.
 You can use the id attribute to target elements within 
a page that can be linked to.

```

## Layout 

```
<div> elements are often used as containing elements 
to group together sections of a page.
 Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you 
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
 The float property moves content to the left or right 
of the page and can be used to create multi-column 
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
 Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
 Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide, 
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
 Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
 CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
 You can include multiple CSS files in one page

```

##  Functions, Methods, and Objects 

```
Functions allow you to group a set of related 
statements together that represent a single task. 
Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required 
to do their job) and may return a value. 
An object is a series of variables and functions that 
represent something from the world around you. 
In an object, variables are known as properties of the 
object; functions are known as methods of the object. 
Web browsers implement objects that represent both 
the browser window and the document loaded into the 
browser window. 
JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as 
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and 
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts. 
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data 
sets (and both can contain the other).

##  6 Reasons for Pair Programming

```

Iterative loops. Code reviews. Fast feedback. Error checking and linting. These are software engineering practices that have proven to dramatically improve the quality of code developers produce.

How does pair programming work?

While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the «mechanics» of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.

Why pair program?

Pair programming touches on all four skills: developers explain out loud what the code should do, listen to others’ guidance, read code that others have written, and write code themselves.


Greater efficiency

It is a common misconception that pair programming takes a lot longer and is less efficient. In reality, when two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. Research indicates that pair programing takes slightly longer, but produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging .

Engaged collaboration

When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work.

Learning from fellow students

Everyone has a different approach to problem solving; working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. If one developer has a unique approach to a specific problem, pair programming exposes the other developer to a new solution.


Social skills

Pair programming is great for improving social skills. When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key. This can become more difficult when two programmers have different personalities.

Job interview readiness

A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base.

Work environment readiness

Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product.
